## SmartCMS
This is an old project I have written in 2010. It contains very basic functionality, like:
* Articles publication contol (publish/unpublish)
* WYSIWYG editor
* Photo galleries (publish/unpublish)
* Easy to customize, based on object-oriented PHP and modern template system (PHPTAL)

It is still used in production ;)

### How to run
Note: you need MySQL to run

1. Adjust config/global.php
2. Seed database from the setup dir (php mysql_install.php)
3. Run typing php -S localhost:8080
4. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080
